#1 Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.
  - See ArrayApp.cs

#2 Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.
  - See RotateCharApp.cs

#3 If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?
  - If I could change one thing about C# as a language, I would give the user the option to use curly braces to indicate different blocks of code or use whitespace like in Python. 
      In my opinion both have their benefits when it comes to the appearance of the code and efficiency of writing the code
